                        <br> Drôle de Monsieur cannot be held liable for any action and/or charges and/or taxes (which are the responsibility of the Customer) and/or any delays due to customs services over which it has no control. <br>
                        <br> For all Products, the Order will be prepared for dispatch at the Drôle de Monsieur warehouse within a maximum period of three (3) business days from the day following the validation of the Order. Orders registered on the Website https://droledemonsieur.com/ on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday will be processed on the following Monday.

                        <br> During private sale, sale or archive sale periods, the shipping period may be extended by a maximum of 15 working days. It may also be extended to the day after a new collection goes online or during the Christmas shopping period between 23 November and 31 December. <br>
                        <br> If the Product(s) ordered have not been delivered within 30 business days of the indicative delivery date, for any reason other than force majeure or the fault of the Customer, the sale may be cancelled at the written request of the Customer in accordance with the conditions provided for in Articles L216-2, L216-3 and L241-4 of the ‘Code de la consommation’ (the French Consumer Code).

This verification is considered to have been carried out once the Customer, or a person of their choice, has signed the delivery slip. No claim about the condition of the delivered package(s) will be accepted. <br><br> In the event of absence, wrong address or a refusal of the package by the recipient, which makes it impossible to deliver the Order to the recipient on time, Drôle de Monsieur cannot be held liable for the final quality of the delivery. In the absence of the recipient, according to the delivery terms and conditions of the carrier, the Product(s) may be re-presented again and/or deposited at a relay point and/or returned to Drôle de Monsieur. <br><br> In the event that it is impossible to make delivery, no reshipment will be made and the Customer will be reimbursed within 14 days of receipt of the Order by Drôle de Monsieur. <br><br> Deliveries are made using the services of: <br><br><span><ol class="list-disc" style="padding-left: 20px;"><li> COLISSIMO (standard delivery) and UPS (express delivery) for mainland France; and</li><li>Mostly DHL and Chronopost for international (standard and express) delivery.All international orders are placed through Global-E, our international shipping provider, and shipped from our warehouse in France.</li></ol></span><br> Customers will be prompted to use our shipping partner, Global-E, upon chekout.
